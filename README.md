# quotient_hard_disks
This repository contains the source codes and the relevant data for the publication of "Quotient Maps and Spaces of the Configuration Spaces of Hard Disks".

The folders 'hexagonal_torus' and 'square_torus' contain the corresponding source codes and the data to regenerate all the results presented in this paper. The folders are organized as follows:

- The folder 'finding_critical_points' contains the source code (both in C++ and MATLAB) to find the critical points and the critical points themselves.
