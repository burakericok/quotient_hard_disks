# quotient_hard_disks
This repository contains the source codes and the relevant data for the publication of "Quotient Maps and Spaces of the Configuration Spaces of Hard Disks".

## **Content**
The folders 'hexagonal_torus' and 'square_torus' contain the corresponding source codes and the data to regenerate all the results presented in this paper. The folders are organized as follows:

- The folder 'data' contains all the necessary data files to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- The folder 'descriptors' contains the source codes regarding Sec. 5 and App. B of the publication.
- The folder 'distances' contains the source codes regardig Sec.4 and App. A.
- The folder 'finding_critical_points' contains the source code (both in C++ and MATLAB) to find the critical points and the critical points themselves. 
- The folder 'quotient_t' contains the source codes regarding Sec. 6.1.
- The folder 'quotient_pti' contains the source codes regarding Sec. 6.2.
- The folder 'quotient_ptil' contains the source codes regarding Sec. 6.3.

The usage of each folder is further explained in the corresponding README.txt files within the folder.
